php artisan make:model Post -m

# Model + Migration + Controller (non-resource)
php artisan make:model Post -mc

# Model + Migration + Factory + Seeder + Controller
php artisan make:model Post -mfscr

# All common components (common shortcut)
php artisan make:model Post -a
# Equivalent to: -mfsrc (migration, factory, seeder, resource controller)

run migrations:
php artisan migrate

php artisan migrate:rollback --path=database/migrations/2026_02_03_075146_create_posts_table.php

this line in web.php will create resource feature route that will create a whole bunch of routes to acces methods in PostController.php
or all methods in PostController class will be use as resource for Posts
Route::resource('posts', PostController::class);

this will return posts folder with file named index.blade.php
 public function index()
    {
        $posts = Post::all(); // this will grab all data inside the db and assign to variable array $posts
        Post is the Post model
        all::() is a static method
        return view('posts.index', compact('posts'));
    } 

Model methods:
all()
find()
create()
update()
delete()
